# Targeted Memory Reactivation Experiment

![Study Image](favicons/android-chrome-192x192.png)


## Overview

This project hosts a 4-day experiment designed to study the effects of Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) on the retention of Japanese vocabulary by French native speakers. The experiment is conducted entirely online and involves multiple testing sessions over four consecutive days.

## Experiment Structure

### Day 1: Initial Learning and Testing
- **Task:** Participants hear 60 Japanese words while simultaneously seeing their French translations.
- **Test:** After the learning session, participants are tested by hearing each Japanese word and writing down the corresponding French translation.

### Day 2: Testing with Feedback
- **Test 1:** Participants take the same test as Day 1, but this time they receive feedback by seeing the correct answer after entering their guess.
- **Test 2:** Immediately after Test 1, participants take another test without feedback.

### Day 3: Repeat of Day 2
- **Test 1:** Same structure as Day 2, including feedback after the first test.
- **Test 2:** Second test without feedback, following Test 1.

### Day 4: Final Test
- **Test:** Participants take a final test, just as in Day 1.

## Memory Reactivation Protocol

During the nights following Days 1, 2, and 3:
- **Group 1:** Hears a recording of 30 randomly selected Japanese words out of the original 60 while they sleep, aiming to reactivate memories of those words.
- **Group 2:** Hears white noise during sleep, serving as a control for auditory stimulation.
- **Group 3:** Hears nothing during sleep, serving as a control group for both auditory stimulation and memory reactivation.

## How to Participate

Participants were contacted directly to take part. If you still wish to test yourself or contribute to a larger future study, you may do so. To participate in this study, participants must be native French speakers (for now). Instructions and participation details will be added to the website in the future. As of now, a .csv file with the day's result is downloaded automatically for viewing after each day.
